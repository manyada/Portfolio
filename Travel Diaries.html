            India!!!
                India is one of my favorite places to visit as all of my grandparents, relatives and many friends are 
                there! It is a very beautiful place and it is my motherland. I am proud to be an Indian!

            California (That is where I was born)
                From San Diego to Disneyland, my family and I have traveled almost all over the state of 
                California! I lived there for the first one-and-a-half years of my life.

            Idaho
                We went to Idaho for two days to visit our family friends who had recently moved there. It is 
                very rocky and mountainous place. There are many recreational activities throughout the state 
                and there is a lot of wilderness there! We also went to the temple there!

            Alaska
                We went on a cruise and we saw orcas and a lot of birds. There were so many glaciers and icebergs 
                all around us! It was so cold! We also went in a chopper and saw all these sights up close!

            Hawaii
                We went to the island of Maui and went in an aerial taxi and travelled through the mountains! 
                We went to many beaches and went snorkeling in Hawaii! There were many beautiful sunsets there and 
                the weather is so nice! We saw underwater coral reefs and saw so many sea creatures, including turtles!

            New York
                We went to New York in 2013, and visited the Times Square, saw the Empire State building, and 
                went on a bus tour! We also went to the Statue of Liberty! We went on a river cruise too!

            Texas
                It is extremely hot in Texas! It goes to 100 degrees easily and I started sweating immediately 
                once our flight landed! There is the world famous restroom, inside a store known as Buccees there 
                and it has over 80 gas pumps! There is also the famous Blue Bell ice cream and Sub-Zero ice cream 
                there, which they make using liquid nitrogen! 
                This is by far one of my most favorite places! We went 
                to visit my cousins there in 2019 summer. We had a blast!

            These are a few of the places I have been to in my life! There are many more places and I will update 
            you soon on them! Safe travels for now!
